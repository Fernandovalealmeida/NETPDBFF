# NetPDBFF

NetPDBFF will document and connect all people who have participated in the
Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (PDBFF) across its
history — researchers, field assistants, students, staff, and
collaborators, past and present.

This repository currently contains the project foundation (tooling,
structure, documentation), the M3.1 identity-foundation database schema, and
an M4 email/password authentication vertical slice (see
`docs/authentication-implementation.md`). Profiles, person claiming,
institutions, and search are not implemented yet. See
`docs/development-roadmap.md` for what comes next.

## Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in real values as they become
relevant. Never commit `.env.local` or any file containing real secrets.

## Internationalization

The interface language at launch is English. The codebase is structured to
support Portuguese as a future addition without requiring a rewrite — see
`docs/architecture.md`.

## M7 — Knowledge Network Engine

M7 connects the preserved records through a derived, provenance-preserving read model (no generic edge store, no universal Entity table, no graph database). See `docs/decisions/0017-knowledge-network-engine.md`, `docs/m7-knowledge-network-engine.md`, and `docs/m7-knowledge-network-engine-engineering-report.md`.

## M8 — Knowledge Revelation

M8 **reveals** what the preserved, connected record already demonstrates: it composes several canonical Assertions into the deterministic patterns their joint truth entails, decomposable back to them — no inference, similarity, recommendation, ranking, centrality, or interpretation. The design phase is ratified (the M8 Definitive Specification, Design Bible, Benchmarking Report, Critical Review, and Engineering Blueprint). **M8.1** implements the first lens — co-presence: the documented cohorts a person belonged to (other people at the same institution during overlapping periods), read inline on the biography. See `docs/decisions/0018-revelation-engine.md` and `docs/m8.1-co-presence-revelation.md`.

**M8.2** extends revelation to the **institution surface**: the *documented co-presence* within one institution — which participants the record places there at the same time as which others — read inline on `/institutions/[organizationId]` after its Participation/Contributions engines. It is the institution-vantage mirror of M8.1 (same `participations` composition, same pairwise overlap rule, decomposable back to the rows), reusing the M8.1 co-presence presentation. Event company (no event reading surface) and comparison C5 (its M8.3 lineage host) are deferred. See `docs/m8.2-institution-co-presence-revelation.md` and `docs/m8.2-institution-co-presence-revelation-engineering-report.md`.

**M8.3** adds the **lineage** family (C2): the documented **succession/formation descent** of an institution (kinds succession + merger), read inline on `/institutions/[organizationId]`, and the documented **mentorship descent** of a person (kind mentorship), read inline on `/people/[personId]`. Each is a bounded, cycle-safe transitive chain of same-kind directional records, each step decomposable to its canonical relationship row, both endpoints doorways; it records what followed what, never what followed from what. Comparison C5 is enabled but not assigned (deferred). See `docs/m8.3-lineage-institutional-evolution.md` and its engineering report.

**M8.4** adds the **continuity & rupture** family (C3): for one institution, the documented **coverage** of each participation capacity over time — the merged year-intervals of its dated `participations` and the silences between them — read inline on `/institutions/[organizationId]` after the M8.3 descent, alongside the institution's own recorded status and closure. It holds four honest states apart and never collapses them: continuation (an open-ended latest interval), rupture (the terminal status vocabulary + closure date), an evidentiary gap (a whole-year silence, never an end), and an unknown outcome (a record that merely stops — "not documented what followed", never "ended"). Every coverage span decomposes to its participation records; rupture is grounded only in the explicit `organizations.status`, never in the record's shape, and never dates a particular capacity's end. Recurrence (C4), bounded pathway (C6), and comparison (C5, enabled) remain deferred. See `docs/m8.4-continuity-rupture.md` and its engineering report.

**M8.5** adds the **recurrence** family (C4): the phenomena the record documents as having occurred more than once for a focal entity — for a person, the same role held again at an institution, events of the same kind, and contributions of the same kind (`reveal_person_recurrence`); for an institution, same-kind events and contributions (`reveal_organization_recurrence`, participations excluded — M8.4 continuity owns per-capacity coverage). Each groups the entity's own explicit assertions by a structural key and reveals each group with **≥ 2** distinct occurrences, with a plain count and the occurrences in time order (undated last), each decomposable to its canonical record. Recurrence is **not similarity**: a GROUP BY + COUNT over identical explicit key values — no AI, clustering, pattern mining, embedding, prediction, or inference. The count is a count of records, never a metric; groups are never ordered by count; a single documented occurrence is not recurrence. Read inline on `/people/[personId]` (after cohorts and lineage) and `/institutions/[organizationId]` (after continuity). Scope: single-entity repetition (ratified; the dyadic co-appearance count of Spec §3.5 is deferred). See `docs/m8.5-recurrence.md` and its engineering report.
