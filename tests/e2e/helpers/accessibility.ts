// proposed in docs/m5-application-ui-design-system.md item 10's "Proposed
// new dependencies" and installed in M5.5 to actually implement that
// item's acceptance criterion -- so every accessibility test runs the same
// configured scan and the same critical/serious gate, rather than each
// test hand-rolling AxeBuilder options and its own violation-formatting
// logic. Generic and route-agnostic by design: nothing here is
// NetPDBFF/PDBFF-specific, consistent with
// docs/decisions/0007-netpdbff-first-vertical-general-research-infrastructure.md's
// naming discipline for shared test/helper infrastructure -- any future
// product built on this architecture could reuse this file unchanged.
