// Content model for the M6 System Exhibition dev route (see
// src/app/dev/exhibition/page.tsx and docs/m6-system-exhibition.md).
//
// The exhibition is a DETERMINISTIC DEVELOPER INSPECTION ENVIRONMENT — not a
// product surface and not a complement to one. It never duplicates
// production functionality: general browsing of People, Institutions, and
// Contributions lives only in the application (the /explore hub and the
// /people, /institutions, /contributions directories). This environment
// exists only to inspect deterministic examples, edge cases, canonical-
// record reuse, reviewer demonstrations, architectural concepts, and
// fictional showcase data, and to hold the reset instructions.
//
// This module is intentionally pure and framework-agnostic (no React, no
// server-only imports) so it can be unit-tested directly. The deterministic
// UUIDs below MIRROR the local seed at supabase/seeds/m6_exhibition.sql —
// the exhibition never invents records; it only links to canonical seeded
// ones. Keep the two files in sync (the DB showcase test asserts these ids
// exist).
