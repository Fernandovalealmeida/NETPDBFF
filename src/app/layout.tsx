    // the time React hydrates, the browser has already run the script and
    // added the attribute. React's hydration diffing sees that as a
    // mismatch and warns — correctly, since the DOM genuinely doesn't match
    // what RootLayout's JSX alone would produce, but *incorrectly* as a bug
    // report, since this is the intended, documented mechanism, not a
    // rendering defect. This is the standard, narrowly-scoped fix for
    // exactly this situation (the same pattern `next-themes` itself uses
    // internally) — see React's own docs on `suppressHydrationWarning` for
    // "an element's attribute or text content will (necessarily) differ
    // between the server and the client, and you can't fix it."
