// password reset started from the recovery email link*
// (/auth/confirm?type=recovery), not a general "change your password while
// signed in" page — that will live at /account/security once voluntary
// password changes are implemented (see docs/authentication-implementation.md,
// "/update-password scope" and "What remains").
//
// The `(protected)` layout (src/app/(protected)/layout.tsx) already
// guarantees a real, verified Supabase session before this component ever
// renders — an unauthenticated visitor never reaches the code below,
// regardless of any cookie they might be carrying. What this page
// additionally checks is a *UX hint*, not a second authorization layer:
// the recovery-flow hint cookie set by /auth/confirm
// (src/lib/auth/recovery-flow-hint.ts — read that file before assuming
// this check does more than it does). Its presence just picks which
// explanation to show. A signed-in visitor who never went through the
// recovery link — or who set this cookie themselves — can still reach the
// password form below; what they can do with it is unchanged either way:
// change the password of the account they're already signed in as. See
// "Password-update authorization" in docs/authentication-implementation.md.
