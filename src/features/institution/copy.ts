// Centralized, honest, Node-neutral copy for the Institution surfaces. No
// PDBFF-specific language (unit-tested), no corporate/marketing language, no
// engagement or "complete this profile" prompts, no statistics as a substitute
// for history. Absence is information: an institution with little recorded
// history stays dignified. Works unchanged for a university, a museum, an
// archive, a field station, an Indigenous organization, or a community
// association.
