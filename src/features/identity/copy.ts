// Pure state-to-copy mapping for IdentityStatus — see
// tests/unit/identity-copy.test.ts. Never includes decision_notes or any
// reviewer/administrative field: per the milestone's explicit requirement,
// the claimant sees what their status means, not why a reviewer decided
// it. No fabricated data (participation, network, publications) appears
// in any of this copy.
//
// Production Experience Phase I: the no_claim copy states the truth of the
// product TODAY — claiming a person record is a real, available workflow
// (M5.3), reached by the "Claim a person record" action on /member. Earlier
// wording that described claiming, participation, and the network as a "later
// milestone" was obsolete once those engines shipped (M5.3–M7) and is removed.
