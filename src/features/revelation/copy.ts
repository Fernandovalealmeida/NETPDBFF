// Centralized, honest, Node-neutral copy for the Revelation surfaces, and the

// AI-generated prose (a revealed person reads only from what its participation

// prestige, popularity, influence, similarity, recommendation, or "most
// connected" language anywhere. Unit-tested for Node-neutrality and the absence
// of that vocabulary.
//
// The co-presence lenses state plainly that they show a DOCUMENTED co-presence --
// a record that people were at the same institution in overlapping years -- and
// NOT that they knew one another, worked together, or formed a group (that would
// be inference/interpretation, which M8 refuses). They also state that the
// co-presence shown is the DOCUMENTED one, not the true one, and that absence is
// never proof no co-presence exists. Per the M8 Specification's structural-naming
// rule (Spec Sec.2 flags calling a documented cohort "a generation" as
// interpretation), the institution surface says "documented co-presence", never
// "generation".
