// The single source of navigation entries — see types.ts for the shape and
// full reasoning. PublicHeader, ProtectedHeader, the user menu, and
// MobileNavigation all read from `navigationConfig` (via the selectors in
// select.ts); none of them declares a competing list of links.
//
// Only entries that are true today are marked `available`. `planned`
// entries are reserved slots for routes named as future work in
// docs/application-information-architecture.md — adding them here does not
// implement those routes (no page exists at their would-be href), it only
// lets the nav communicate "this exists in the product's structure" without
// ever rendering a functional link to a page that 404s. See NavLink for how
// `planned` renders.
